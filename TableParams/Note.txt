Capillary 8 Note

It is proven that at the end of capillary was not filled with collagen material. DUe to this reason there is a
underpressure comapred with the Atmoshperic pressure. This experiment fails due to this reason.
Capillary with 8 mm is not suitable for this kind of material with this methodological approach.


According to the our results, the exit pressure at the end of the capillary equals to atmoshperic pressure. 
There is no confirmed elastic behaviour which can be evaluated from exit pressure.
